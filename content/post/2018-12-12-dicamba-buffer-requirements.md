summary: 'On October 31, 2018 the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced their decision to extend the registration of the dicamba products Engenia, Fexapan, and Xtendimax for use in dicamba-tolerant crops (Xtend technology) through December 20, 2020; however, additional label changes were made. In this post, I (try to) address the new **57-foot omnidirectional buffer** requirement to protect federally listed threatened and endangered species and critical habitat in specific US counties.'

On October 31, 2018 the United States [**Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**] (https://www.epa.gov/) announced their decision to extend the registration of the dicamba products Engenia, Fexapan, and Xtendimax for use in dicamba-tolerant crops (Xtend technology) through December 20, 2020; however, [**additional label changes**] (https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-changes-dicamba-registration) were made. 

A particular change that has led to some questioning is the new **57-foot omnidirectional buffer** requirement to protect federally listed threatened and endangered species and critical habitat in specific US counties. On November 19, 2018, EPA posted the [**list of US counties**] (https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2016-0187-0974) where threatened and endangered species and critical habitat may exist (thus locations where the new 57-foot buffer must be incorporated). 
218 US counties in 24 states are listed; see maps and figure below:

Another significant label change pertaining to buffer requirements is that additional **non-sensitive areas** may be included as part of the 110-foot downwind buffer and also the 57-foot omnidirectional buffer. 

According to EPA, the following areas (“non-sensitive areas”) may be included in the buffer distance calculation when directly adjacent to the treated field edges: 

+ "Roads, paved or gravel surfaces, mowed and/or managed areas adjacent to field such as rights of way." 
+ "Planted agricultural fields containing: corn, cotton, and soybeans."
+ "Areas covered by the footprint of a building, silo, or other man made structure with walls and or roof.”

## **Practical Implications for Certified Applicators:**
+ It is required for certified applicators using these products (Engenia, Fexapan and/or Xtendimax) to follow the measures contained in the Endangered Species Bulletins for the area which they are applying the product. 

+ To obtain Bulletins, consult **https://www.epa.gov/endangered-species** or call **1-844-447-3813** no more than six months before using the product. Applicators must use the Bulletin valid for the month in which they will apply the product.

+ In the listed counties where threatened and endangered species and critical habitat may exist, besides the 110-foot downwind buffer, 57-foot buffer around the other sides of the field (omnidirectional) are now required.

+ In counties where threatened and endangered species and critical habitat are not listed, the 110-foot downwind buffer still applies. 

+ Non-sensitive areas described above may be included in the buffer distance calculation when directly adjacent to the treated field edges.

+ And remember, DO NOT spray if sensitive crops or residential areas are adjacent and downwind of application area.
