Last week I released a blog post attempting to address the question regarding tank mixing safened S-metolachlor/metolachlor, atrazine and/or mesotrione-based products for weed control in corn (see: [**"Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed? Part-2"**] (http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-2/)). 

The mesotrione products that I checked during my label search (i.e., Callisto, Explorer, Mesotrione 4SC and Meso Star) stated the following restriction: *“DO NOT apply this product post-emergence in a tank mix with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides, unless specifically directed under one of the tank mix section of this label, or crop injury can occur”.*

Safened S-metolachlor products such as Duall II Magnum, Medal EC and Brawl, and safened metolachlor products such as Me-Too-Lachlor II and Stalwart C labeled for use in corn fall under the **emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides** formulation category and thus **SHOULD NOT** be tank-mixed with the **aforementioned** mesotrione products for POST-emergence applications in corn.

**HOWEVER**, there are several safened S-metolachlor/metolachlor and mesotrione products out there and of course I missed checking the label of some. This week I received calls from chemical retailers in Wisconsin mentioning that my blog post was not completely accurate. Guess what? They were right. I even stated the following in the previous article *“Once this post is released there will likely be a “Part 3” coming next because I will certainly forget to address something important; going through the label exercise is not a simple task! That’s when experience comes into play. Growers should always consult an expert before spraying a custom herbicide tank mix. Always read the product label before spraying.”*

Back to the feedback I received, Drexel Chemical Company has a mesotrione product called **[MesoTryOne 4L] (http://www.drexchem.com/products/mesotryone-4l-2/)**. In their [**label**] (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.agrian.com/pdfs/Drexel1a_MesoTryOne_4L_Label.pdf) (page 2), instead of having the particular tank mix being discussed herein under **RESTRICTIONS**, they have it under **USE PRECAUTIONS**: *“Post-emergence applications of this product in tank-mixes with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides may cause severe corn injury or yield loss under adverse weather conditions”*.  

So in this case, the tank mixing of an emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicide with MesoTryOne 4L POST-emergence in corn is considered a legal application; however, the label states that you must apply under “non-adverse weather conditions” to reduce the potential of crop injury. 

If you go to *“Table 5. Tank-mixtures of this Product for PRE-emergence Application in Corn”* (page 9 of the MesoTryOne 4L label), you will see that the mixture of MesoTryOne 4L with Metolachlor (e.g., Me-Too-Lachlor II, Duall II Magnum) is listed; but the same tank mixture is not listed in *“Table 6. Tank-mixtures of this Product for Post-emergence Application in Corn”* (page 9 of the label). Moreover, the tank mixture of commercial pre-mixes of Atrazine + Metolachlor (e.g., Trizmet, Bicep II Magnum) with MesoTryOne 4L are listed in Table 6,  but keep in mind that these pre-mixes are formulated as a suspension concentrate. The concern regarding crop injury comes from having mesotrione tank mixed and sprayed POST-emergence with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides. 

I truly appreciate the positive criticism and feedback from the clientele and industry colleagues! Though my post was not 100% accurate, I certainly got folks to take a closer look at the labels (mission accomplished!). 

Again, going through the label exercise is not a simple task! That’s when experience comes into play. Growers should always consult an expert before spraying a custom herbicide tank mix. 

*Disclaimer: I am not endorsing Drexel Chemical Company and the use of their product MesoTryone 4L (nor the opposite). I am just using their product as a pertinent example for the discussions regarding custom herbicide tank mixtures and label restrictions.*

Always read the product label before spraying.
