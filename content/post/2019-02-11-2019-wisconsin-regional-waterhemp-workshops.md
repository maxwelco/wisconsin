According to our 2018 weed management [**SURVEY**] (http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/2018-wisconsin-cropping-systems-weed-science-survey/), waterhemp has become the most concerning weed species in field crop production in Wisconsin. Thus, we invite farmers and crop advisors to attend one of our Wisconsin Regional Waterhemp Workshops to be held in four locations across the state in March of 2019. 
 
<center> **These workshops are FREE with 3 CEUs (PM) available.**  
[**Download the Promotional Flyer HERE (PDF File)**](/img/2019 Waterhemp Workshops/2019_WaterhempWorkshopFlyer_final.pdf) </center>

These workshops are designed for farmers and crop advisors with little waterhemp experience (Waterhemp 101). Topics include 1) pigweed identification, 2) waterhemp biology, ecology, dispersal and resistance evolution, and 3) herbicide selection and integrated strategies for waterhemp management in alfalfa, corn and soybean.

Presenters include UW-Madison Extension Weed Scientists Drs. Rodrigo Werle and Mark Renz, UW-NPM Outreach Specialists Dan Smith and Richard Proost, and WiscWeeds Lab Members Dr. Maxwel Oliveira, Ryan DeWerff and Sarah Striegel.
