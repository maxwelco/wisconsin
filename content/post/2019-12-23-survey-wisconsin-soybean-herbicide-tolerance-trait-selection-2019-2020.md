Dr. Shawn Conley and team [(Coolbean.info)](https://coolbean.info/) recently released the 2019 yield data from their soybean variety trials conducted across the state of Wisconsin and concluded that no yield differences were observed across herbicide tolerance traits within nor across regions (Enlist E3, RR2 Xtend and LLGT27):

Herein, we would like to ask Wisconsin soybean producers and decision influencers to help us better understand herbicide tolerance trait and POST-emergence herbicide adoption in 2019 and their plans for 2020. This information will be of great value to our educational efforts during this Extension season and research efforts during 2020 and beyond. The survey has 30 questions and should take less than 10 minutes of your time. To start the online survey, please click [**HERE**](https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5dOy1FC5lt3EMp7)
