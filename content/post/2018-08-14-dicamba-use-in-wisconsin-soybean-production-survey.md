In 2017 the Xtend soybean technology was completely launched in the United States (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] approval of dicamba-tolerant seed trait and POST-emergence application of labeled dicamba formulations). Despite the great level of broadleaf weed control observed when dicamba was sprayed POST-emergence in Xtend soybeans, particularly of the troublesome weeds giant ragweed and waterhemp, off-target dicamba movement is still a concern. 

We have designed a short survey intended to investigate Wisconsin soybean farmers’ perceptions on dicamba use in Xtend soybeans. The survey comprises of four main sections:

1. Demographics of participants

2. Outcomes from dicamba application in Xtend soybeans in 2017 and 2018

3. Perceived dicamba injury in non-Xtend soybeans in Xtend 2017 and 2018

4. Expected adoption of the technology in 2019 (assuming it remains available to US soybean farmers in 2019).


We truly appreciate the time of those answering the survey (even if you did not and don’t plan to adopt the technology, please take the time to answer; your feedback is of extreme importance). [Dr. Paul Mitchell] (https://aae.wisc.edu/pdmitchell/), UW-Madison Extension Ag Economist, will assist with data summarization and analysis. Your answers will be kept confidential and the final results will be made available via Wisconsin Crop Manager this fall and presented during winter meetings across Wisconsin. The outcome of the survey will also be shared with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) and US EPA. Moreover, results will help us decide research needs moving forward. We greatly appreciate your time and input.
